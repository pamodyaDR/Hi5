# VCare: To donate, raise awareness and spread hope!

Sri Lankans are known for their generosity and kind-heartedness. On TV and radio broadcasts, on social media pages like Facebook, Instagram, etc. we see and hear about many fundraisers and donation requests from all over the country. Yet many who need such funds and support whether it’s for educational purposes or medical situations so on, their voices go unheard because they cannot reach potential funders and vice versa. 

And also there’s the issue where some funds get scammed and misused in the name of charity. To bring the potential funders, eligible fund receivers, Grama Niladhari of the relevant Division who acts as a middle authority that oversees the validity of the information given by those who request for funds and the non-profit organization that maintains the funds concerning the privacy of the involved parties and gather them on one platform will be an ideal solution. 

VCare is a website to connect all on one platform; to donate :heavy_dollar_sign:, raise awareness :loudspeaker: and spread hope! :two_hearts:

# # Who will join hands with us? :raised_hands:

1. Potential Funders
2. Eligible Fund Receivers
3. Grama Niladhari of the Relevant Division of the Fund Receiver
4. Non-Profit Organizations

# # How it works

VCare, concerning the privacy concerns of the fund receivers, will publish fund requests while certifying information given via _Grama Niladhari_ of the responsible Division, and funders across the country can register on the website and publish your donation motive. As the mediators, the non-profit organization will match potential donors and fund recipients. 
Upon successful submission, the donor will receive a thank you message as a notification :bell:, and when the fund receiver’s request is fulfilled, the request post will be taken down. VCare would also support fundraising for legit charity projects of youth organizations, schools, universities, etc.
