# Hi5
# Sri Lankans are known for their generosity and kind-heartedness. On TV and radio broadcasts, on social media pages like Facebook, Instagram, etc. we see and hear about many fundraisers and donation requests from all over the country. Yet many who are in need of such funds and support whether it’s for educational purposes or for medical situations so on, their voices go unheard because they cannot reach potential funders and vice versa. And also there’s the issue where some funds get scammed and misused in the name of charity. To bring the potential funders, eligible fund receivers, Grama Niladhari of the relevant Division who acts as a middle authority that oversees the validity of the information given by those who request for funds and the non-profit organization that maintains the funds with respect to the privacy of the involved parties and gather them on one platform will be an ideal solution.
